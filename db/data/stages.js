    text: 'A few million years ago the biggest supernova the universe has ever seen, the Kanye Supernova, sent a shockwave through the entire universe. Planets were vaporised, galaxies decimated, the universe itself shifted on its axis. In response to this, the enraged Gods outlawed the primary export of Planet Kanye, Hip Hop. Dark times were ahead. But, from this major disaster came one of the most powerful and pimpin nebulas in the universe, Nebula-808. Powered by drum machines, Hennessy and fat blunts, this Nebula rebelled against the oppressive regime of the gods and made their trade the export of black market hip hop. Today, Nebula-808 is the home of the best hip-hop artists in the universe, and they have set up a stage for the Woozu Festival in their citadel.   ',

    text: 'If you look closesly at the Jungle Constellation from your window, you will see that the planets and stars are connected. This is not a trick of the light, but it is the body of the beast that inhabits these green planets. This is the Jungle Dragon, and though it may look terrifying, it is the reason that the Jungle Constellation has the best vibes and herbs you could ask for. The beast not only provides safe passage between planets through its arteries, but its bones have been dug into to create homes for anyone who wants to live there. This allows the planets to remain green and wild, acting as the spiritual source for all the music the people of the Jungle Constellation create, and this music in turn feeds the Jungle Dragon. ',
